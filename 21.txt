1. ffmpeg
	ffmpeg [global_options] {[input_file_options] -i input_file} ... {[output_file_options] output_file} ...
	rules
		reads from an arbitrary number of input 'files', specified by -i
			which can be regular files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc

		writes to an arbitrary number of output 'files'
			anything found on the command line which cannot be interpreted as an option is considered to be an output filename

		Each input or output file can contain any number of streams of different types			video/audio/subtitle/attachment/data

		Selecting which streams from which inputs will go into which output 
			is either done automatically or with the -map option

		to refer to a file, use 0-based indices
			2:3 refers to the 4th stream in the 3rd file

		options are applied to the next specified file
			except the global options

	transcoding process
		input file -demuxer-> encoded data packets -decoder-> decoded (uncompress) frames
		raw frames can be processed by filtering
		raw frames -encode-> encoded data packets -muxer-> output file

2. filtering
	simple filtergraphs
		are those have exactly one input and output, both of the same type
		configured with the per-stream -filter option
			(with -vf and -af aliases for video and audio respectively)

	complex filtergraphs
		those cannot be described as simply a linear processing chain applied to one stream
			when there are more than one input and/or output
			or when output stream type is different from input
		configured with -filter_complex option
			note that this option is global

3. stream copy
	by supplying the 'copy' parameter to the -codec option
		makes ffmpeg omit the decoding and encoding step
		so it does only demuxing and muxing
	useful for changing the container format or modifying container-level metadata
	might not work in some cases because of many factors
		filters are not available as well

4. stream selection
	by default, ffmpeg includes only one stream of each type present in the input files and adds them to each output file
		the video with the highest resolution
		the audio with the most channels
		the first subtitle
	
	-vn/-an/-sn/-dn
		diables some of the defaults
	-map
		full control
